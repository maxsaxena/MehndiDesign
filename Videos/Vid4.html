<br><br><strong>1.	Choose high-quality henna:</strong> <br> Ensure that the henna you are using is pure and natural, without any added chemicals or dyes. Fresh henna powder will give you better results.
<br><br><strong>2.	Prepare the paste correctly: </strong> <br>Mix henna powder with water or lemon juice and let it sit for a few hours to release the dye. You can also add essential oils like eucalyptus or lavender for a better fragrance and to enhance the color.
<br><br><strong>3.	Cleanse and exfoliate your skin: </strong> <br>Before applying mehndi, wash the area you want to decorate and gently exfoliate it to remove any dead skin cells. This will help the henna adhere better and result in a more vibrant stain.
<br><br><strong>4.	Apply a thin and even layer: </strong> <br>Use a cone or squeeze bottle to apply the mehndi. Start from the center and work your way outwards, ensuring the lines are smooth and consistent. Apply the paste thinly for better control and to avoid smudging.
<br><br><strong>5.	Let the design dry: </strong> <br>Once you've finished applying the mehndi, allow it to dry naturally. Avoid touching or smudging the design during this time, as it can affect the final result.
<br><br><strong>6.	Seal the design: </strong> <br>To enhance the color and improve longevity, you can seal the design by applying a sugar-lemon mixture or a mehndi sealant. This will help keep the henna paste in place and prevent it from flaking off too soon.
<br><br><strong>7.	Keep it on for an adequate duration: </strong> <br>The longer you keep the mehndi paste on your skin, the darker the stain will be. Ideally, leave it on for at least 4-6 hours or overnight if possible. Avoid contact with water during this time.
<br><br><strong>8.	Scrape off the dried paste: </strong> <br>Once the henna paste has completely dried and hardened, gently scrape it off using a blunt object like a butter knife or a credit card. Avoid using water at this stage.
<br><br><strong>9.	Avoid contact with water for the next 24 hours: </strong> <br>To allow the henna stain to fully develop and deepen, refrain from washing the design with water for the first day. You can use a lemon-sugar sealant or natural oil to moisturize the area instead.
<br><br><strong>10.	Moisturize and protect the design: </strong> <br>After the initial 24 hours, moisturize the mehndi design with natural oils like coconut oil or shea butter. This will help prevent the stain from fading too quickly.
<br><br><br>Remember, individual skin chemistry and other factors can influence the final result of your mehndi design. It's essential to experiment and find what works best for you.
